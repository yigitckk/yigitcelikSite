I'm into mathematics, programming, languages, and philosophy. I love to make innovations around me and always think with a growth mindset. I'm a quick solver on the problems that I have. I love to meet with new people in various aspects all the time and be in interactive talks with them. I have 7+ cultural, youth, and student exchange experiences in Erasmus+ programs, so far I have experience in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C, C# languages and at the moment being busy with Java. My motive is to keep creating something valuable for the world, therefore I'm open to new challenges and experiences!",
